[Information Security Analytics](https://www.amazon.com/Information-Security-Analytics-Insights-Anomalies-ebook/dp/B00QIHRDR2?ie=UTF8&ref_=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top) by Mark Talabis takes various approaches how to do
analytics with a low budget. The author describes ways from 
managing huge amounts of log files with hadoop and map reduce to text
mining based on the R language. So, if you are considering buying
a security incident and event management system (SIEM) - read this book first.
Why? Because it helps you to find the real questions, you should ask before
setting up products like Splunk or Qradar. Thereby the book provides you
with easy to understand examples on how to analyse huge amounts of log files
and what to look for within these. The author always starts with a very
simple step and then extends this into a full blown analysis. As a reader 
with nearly no coding skills - it is easy to follow. Do not stop with the 
provided examples, extend them to real world examples and play around with 
them. These experiments will pay off later, when you are working with a 
real SIEM solution.

The same holds for the chapter on modeling. Here all the necessary software
to follow the examples are provided by the author to download and run as
a virtual machine within your environment. This is very helpful. Just in
case you are familiar with risk assessments and risk management principles, 
this books helps you to set up threat simulations and test your current
approaches.

The authors dedicated about 60 pages to the topic. This amount has been 
well chosen: not to short - not to long. And as you see - I'll keep this
review short as well. Go, buy the book read it and experiment with the
ideas and code the authors provide. 

Cheers!
