The Gray Hat Hackers Handbook, as published in January 2011, claims to
summarize the knowledge a Gray Hat should have. Well, I am not so happy
with it. It covers a lot of material: starting from USB stick
based attacks to malware and programming. However there are many
chapters within this [book](http://www.amazon.com/Hacking-Ethical-Hackers-Handbook-Edition/dp/0071742557/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8)
that simply show you how install or use some tools. That is not what
I would expect from some one who wants to become or allready is a gray
hat. If you can not read the manual and think way beyond it you are doing
some thing wrong.

Remarkably is the chapter on disclosure and the ethics related to it. 
Unfortunately it is too short! Similar thing happened to chapter 17 which
focusses on application security. The Web Application Part is so small and
hardly gives the reader a foothold to dig deeper into the field of finding
Vulns in specially crafted applications. Within the following chapters
the authors take a very high level and mainly tool focussed perspective on
VOIP- and SCADA hacking. Given the medias attention to these topic within
2010 - 2012 I would have expected more content and less tool descriptions.

The chapters on exploit development, shellcodes and return oriented 
programming are written very well. They explain in great detail how to do
such things and heavily rely on AlephOnes work. If you are new to it or
have already written shellcodes and exploits - you will always learn 
some thing from these chapters.

So, to get it to a point: Nice read, but focussing to much on tools. Read
a few blogs and skip this book.

Cheers!
