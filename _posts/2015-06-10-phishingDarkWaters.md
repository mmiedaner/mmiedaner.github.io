title: Christopher Hadnagy, Michelle Fincher - Phishing Dark Waters - The Offensive and Defensive Sides of Malicious E-mails 
category: bookreview
---

Phishing is a problem everybody is confronted with every day. 
It is not only limited to email also telephone calls, SMS or 
even DNS-Changes fall into this category. But let us focus on 
emails as the authors did. The border line between a phishing 
email and regular spam is hard to draw these days. In addition 
the amount of phishing emails send every month increases 
steadily. The consequences of clicking on a malicious link 
or opening an attachment containing malware increase as well 
- just remember the cryptolocker trojan reports when even 
police stations lost all their data and paid the ransom.
However the authors start their book with explaining how 
to recognize a phishing email and illustrate it with a lot 
of examples. Step by step they work the reader from verifying 
the senders address to finally validating the mail-headers. 
Their approach seems to very simple and elegant. The basically 
follow the reading behavior for reading email - from top to bottom. 
This dry topic gets extended by minor stories the authors 
carefully place to enforce a mental picture and to easily 
remember the step. The second chapter continues to explain 
how the brain of the victim works. Starting off with the 
various biases everybody has when making decisions. They 
also discuss how strong emotions like fear, anxiety or 
curiosity diminish your possibilities to make a serious 
decision. As in the previous chapter this part is well 
illustrated by various stories that happened to the authors 
- remarkably outlining the basic message and helping you 
to remember / recognize a similar situation. I still cannot 
forget the story about surfing on a cold day and breaking 
the board.

After this emotional and psychological lecture Christopher 
Hadnagy and Michelle Fincher return to explain how to protect 
against phishing emails. The steps here are explained in a 
way to be reused in your awareness campaigns right away. 
For everyone working on how to train your employees - that 
chapter is a must read. While the second half of it describes 
various approaches to handle phishing emails as experienced 
by the authors in the wild. They do not hesitate to discuss 
these approaches fairly. It is interesting to see what has 
been tried and why it may not be the best choice. The last 
part of book focusses on how to setup your own phishing 
campaign or how to manage it in case you decide to buy it 
as a service. Again as in the beginning Christopher Hadnagy 
and Michelle Fincher provide an easy to understand and very 
intuitive step by step approach. Besides technical and 
managerial aspects they also discuss the ethics or moral 
part of planning and designing a phishing awareness program. 
Examples here focus especially on the content / pretext of 
the emails itself and how the relate to the emotional 
challenges such an email may pose on certain employees. 
In one story the authors describe how they fought a company 
to use a pretext based on the anniversary of 09/11 and 
finally switched to another pretext on request by their 
customer - well knowing that the "bad guys" would not 
hesitate to use such a pretext. Of course a section on 
tooling is not missing. Christopher Hadnagy discusses 
various free, open source as well as commercial tools. 
Besides an analysis of the capabilities of the tools also 
his personal opinion and experiences with the tools is 
included in separate sub chapters.

All in all this book is very good starting point for 
every security professional who is in charge of setting 
up an awareness program for his or her company and stumbles 
upon the topic of phishing.
