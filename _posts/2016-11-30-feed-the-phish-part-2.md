Hey! Welcome to part II of "Feeding The Phish". Now your emails
are arriving in the victims inbox? Great! People will be coming
back to you and giving you feedback - even if you have not asked 
about it. Honestly, get ready to receive anything from questions
for help to angry shouts. I was honestly surprised by the amount of
positive emails and phone calls I received. Clearly, not every body
was happy - but most found the "exercise" quite useful. In addition
some colleges pointed out obvious mistakes, like sending the invitation
to a competition which you should answer within two hours. Yeah, 
easy to do, if the email arrives in your email box around midnight.
Others mentioned that the landing page, which they reached after the
click, was too friendly. Take such impulses seriously and react on them.
Over time, you will find the right way and the right words.


Equally important as the feedback is how you track the expected reaction
of colleges. Have you set up an email list every one should send possible
phishing emails to? Or is there any other procedure within your company
how normal employees can inform the IT- and IT-Security staff about an
ongoing attack? Monitor those channels closely. Count and analyse the
feedback. 


Is your detection rate high or too low? The highest correct
response rate I received so far was about two thirds of all possible
victims following the correct procedure. That was a really simple campaign.
Maybe the phish was to simple. However rewarding such a result publicly is
very important. Like Steve Jobs did it at Apple - celebrate such successes!!


This brings me to an other interesting question: How do you detect if a 
phish was to simple or if your colleges really got better in detecting 
the attack? There are several ways. Start by organising all victims in 
groups and measuring the click rate per group. This way, you see the
hot spots for the upcoming awareness training. The ratio of clicks versus 
reported phishs is the metric to go for. All groups which have a higher 
or even click rate than reporting rate should be candidates for training. 
There is one more metric you should look out for: the group with the 
lowest detection rate at all. In my campaigns I could identify one group 
of about 20 employees, which did not react at all on the phishs. They 
neither reported them nor did the click on them. Strange, but seriously 
worth talking to them. As it turned out, they were very well organised 
internally. One employee spotted the phish and informed all other members 
of the group. What a dynamic and responsible action!


How people reported the phishing attack is also interesting. There will 
always be groups who run for the phone and need to call some one. Whom?
Yes, IT Support / the Call Center. Keep that in mind when you select the
groups for your campaign. Do not flood the poor support guys too hard.


In the final part of this blog post series I will discuss the communication
aspects before and after each campaign. So - see you again in a two
weeks.

Cheers!
