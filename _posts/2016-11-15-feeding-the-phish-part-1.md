Feeding The Phish? Have you ever conducted a phishing campaign at
your company or workplace? It is an interesting exercise. After a
few campaigns I decided to reflect on them and share what went good
and what went wrong.

First of all: When you want to feed the phish you need to talk, talk and
talk again. Not only is it important to collect every management buying
that you can think of - you need as well inform and convince many people
about your endeavour. Nothing kills your efforts faster than a firewall
admin that feels left out. To ensure that communication works an reaches
all important places you need to build a team, which includes at least 
someone from:

* Sales / Marketing
* Firewall and E-Mail administration
* IT Support or the Call Center

Why? Let marketing pick the words for selling your campaign. The IT 
administration will pave the way for your phishs and the clicks. Finally
the Call Center / IT Support Team will take the hard punch, when
everybody calls them panicking because they clicked your phishing email.
But on the other hand you should keep this team small and keep the talk low
not to spoil everything before the first email has arrived.


When you start, start simple. You will be surprised what a plain text email
can do. Especially if you've 
chosen the right topic. And here we are at one of the most important 
points. Why are you doing this campaign? It is not to scare people, because
everybody will fall for a phishing email. This is just a matter of 
how well it is prepared and tailored to the victim. So, the goal should be
to help your colleges to get a teachable moment and learn a little bit. 
Stay away from inhouse topics and make sure that you do not touch on or
slightly abuse the efforts of other departments or even management with the
context of your phishing campaign. Good examples are coupon codes that
are handed out by the work council or an invitation to the departmental 
Christmas party. These are things that should not get burned in a phishing
campaign. Also there exist some consulting companies suggesting exactly
that. Always bear in mind: You will still be at your company when those
consultants have left :)

Anyhow, once you have chosen an appropriate context, get ready to spend
some time on the phone ensuring that everything works as planned, when
the first emails arrive. If you are lucky, your company has special
procedures in case of a phishing attack, like tuning firewalls and
mail filters, isolating the victims PC after the click has been reported 
and so on. Things like this will happen. On the one hand it is very 
satisfying to see that what you trained people to do works. On the 
other hand you need to stop those actions fast and quietly to ensure 
that all phishing emails are send and delivered correctly. 

So far we covered the campaign team, the context of the phish and the 
moment when the first emails arrive. In the next blog post we will look
at feedback from the victims and what to do when the campaign is running.
So stay tuned - don't go anywhere.

Cheers :)
