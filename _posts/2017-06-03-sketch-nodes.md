Sketch Noting has been trending for quite a while - but what is it actually?
Mike Rohde defines it in his [book](https://www.amazon.com/Sketchnote-Handbook-illustrated-visual-taking/dp/0321857895/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1496068480&sr=8-1&keywords=sketch+notes) as an illustrated way of note taking. He
thereby combines drawings, typography and structuring items like lines,
arrows, dots and so on into a one maximum two page painting that summarises the
talk he attended.


Why should this be better than regular "word based" note taking? Years over
years I wrote down a lot of word during talks and meetings and spend a lot
of energy on writing and listening at the same time. Sketch notes give you
a way to listen more carefully and focus on the relevant things to 
capture. Combining the words written down with drawings and typography 
helps you even more to remember what you heard. Both can be achieved with
way less energy as writing nearly every word. In addition just text notes
is something you hardly revisit, once recorded. And text is way harder
to search than pictures and illustrations. This technique allows you
to "code" feelings into your notes in a natural way. Something that has
not been easy in simple text. Illustrations really helpful.


Mike Rohdes book can be read very fast - It took me an evening to do that.
However putting his words into practice is not that easy. It takes some
energy and discipline to change your way of note taking. Once it is 
natural for you, you will be amazed in how many situations you can
apply your newly gained knowledge. Personally I use Sketch Notes for 
presentations and while moderating meetings. Of course it works well for
attending meetings, conferences and even webinars.


Finally I do use Sketch Notes for songwriting. It is an ideal tool to 
capture not only the first ideas for lyrics but also record the mood you
would like to combine with the words. Yeah, it is hard to sketch down a
melody that way, but it is not my intend to completely write the song in
this manner. I like to catch ideas for songs and snippets of lyrics or
changes.

In conclusion, it is a great quick read that shows a new tool for tool belt.
Mikes focus on sharing your sketch notes and building a community is 
definitely his personal thing. So go grep and read the book. By the way,
stay away from the kindle version - get the paper back. It feels more
natural reading it this way.
