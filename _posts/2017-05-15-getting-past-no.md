[Getting Past No](https://www.amazon.com/Getting-Past-No-Negotiating-Difficult-ebook/dp/B00IG3YRMU/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1494873829&sr=8-2) was written by William Ury and Roger Fisher. They created
the manual for negotiations. And as most of the time - great wisdom are
the simple things. That is what it boils down to in this book - five
simple steps:


1. Go to the balcony - (control your reactions)

2. Step to their side (try to understand their point of view)

3. Don't reject, reframe (do not say "NO" - rephrase their words)

4. Build them a golden bridge (give them something to say YES to)

5. Bring them to their senses, not their knees (don't force them to say YES)

This sounds pretty easy to do - but is hard to remember and needs a lot
of practice. So do not expect to be a master of negotiation after reading
this book and trying it a few times. You will definitely see improvements,
but there is more. So, let's take a closer look at these five steps.


First - the balcony. I do like this picture. It is really important to
be and keep in control of your reactions. Emotional actions hurt fast and
cut deep wounds. Avoiding those unnecessary fights and scares helps both
you and your counterpart. The balcony is basically a place you imagine and
move your self to when things are getting emotionally in you or during the
discussion. From that spot, like a military general, you have a great view
on the battle field and enough air to breath and to calm down.


In step two you already need to be calm and able to switch point of views
with your counterpart. If you understand how they are feeling and what their
intentions are - it is easier to find a solution that fits both parties.
Most important point here is that everybody loves to talk about one self.
So ask until you are sure, you understand completely the other party.


This takes us to step three - "Don't reject". As you as your question, it
is important not to hurt the other party or push them away by rejecting 
any of their ideas. A situation similar to trying to find a lake behind a 
wall by throwing stones over it and listening to them landing either on 
grass or in the water.


Once you follow all these steps - you often may stop after step 4 - the
golden bridge. What is a golden bridge? Basically it is the best solution
for both. Some common middle ground where everybody wins. It is not always
easy to find - and not always easily seen by both. But pointing the 
discussion towards a golden bridge can end any argument peacefully.


One thing that I have not mentioned yet - and that is the big lecture
I personally took from reading this book is: Always have a BATNA which
translate into "best alternative to a negotiated agreement". 
Once you enter a negotiation you should have made up your mind what the
worst, but still acceptable outcome could be for you. Without a BATNA
you will always end up unhappy and frustrated. But with it you still have
an option if worse comes to worse. You could either stop the negotiation
and escalate the topic or you get away with the necessary minimum - the
BATNA. As a good friend once said: being prepared grants you 70% of the
victory.

Cheers!
