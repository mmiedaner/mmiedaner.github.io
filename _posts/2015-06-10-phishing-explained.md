Phishing is a social engineering attack targeting everyone. 
Clearly the border between spam and phishing is vanishing. 
So what are left with? Emails with malicious links and / or 
attachments. Both trying to make you hand over credentials 
and install malware. Recognising an email as a phish can be 
difficult. Good attacks may only have one or two minor 
“mistakes” which you need to catch. What are typical indicators?

1. Email Addresses. Thoroughly evaluate the address you received 
this email from. Does it really fit to whom it claims to come from? 
If there is any doubt - delete the email immediately. Also be careful 
about the domain the email comes from - minor differences in spelling 
make the email come from a totally different server.

2. Does the email greet you personally or does it use some generic 
greeting? If the later - delete it right away. In case you may do 
delete an important email - sender will get back to you anyway!

3. Is the email written in a way to urge you into doing something? 
Ok, why should someone - you do not know and in relation to a situation 
you are not aware of doing that - via email? Using authority, fear 
or curiosity are clear indicators of phishing emails. The reasoning 
behind building on such emotions is simple. Once you are stressed or 
under a certain emotional pressure you will not make well thought out 
decision. You are more likely to take shortcuts and let your feelings 
determine the decision - so you will click the link or open the 
attachment. Besides the quality of the writing may be an other 
indicator: Spelling mistakes, odd words, grammatical errors, etc. 
all not typical for banks or similar companies.

4. If the email contains a link - carefully validate it. Especially 
take a look at the real target of link not only the link’s name as 
displayed within the email. There are several ways to do that. 
Either you hover your mouse over the link and compare the appearing 
address to the one presented in the email or you switch into plain text 
mode and read the email that way. Here as well, minor spelling differences 
will have a major impact. You will end up on a server that does not 
belong to the claimed target.

5. Attachments - did you really expect an email from this person 
or company including an attachment? If you are not sure upload 
the attachment to sites like [virus total](https://www.virustotal.com/) 
first to check it for known malware. This is still only a partial solution 
because virus total can only be as good as the signatures of the 
anti-virus companies are. Normally those are lacking well behind. 
On a second thought the malware may be encoded differently to 
avoid signature based detection.

Further steps may include checking the mail headers - to see if 
the email originated really from the company it claims to come from. 
However since email servers must face the internet to do their job 
they are one of the first targets to attack and have a high chance 
of being compromised.

So once we understand how to recognise phishing emails it is time 
to think about how to set up an anti-phishing campaign for your 
company. For the next steps I assume that you do have full 
management buy-in as well as a legal counsellor supporting you full 
time. Without these two preconditions you are in deep trouble 
- better you stop right away.

Now you're of to go - cheers!
