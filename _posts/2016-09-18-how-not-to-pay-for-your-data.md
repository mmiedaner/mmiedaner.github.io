How not to pay for your data? Seriously? What is that about?
Crypto Ransomware has been on the rise for quite a while and it
is getting better and more aggressive every day. Not only individuals, 
police stations and smaller hospitals or companies are affected 
big organisations like banks starting to experience very targeted attacks.
Especially in the later case variants of ransom ware were found that
combine several exploits and spread worm like through networks. For 
more information take a look at [Brian Krebs post](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/ransomware-getting-more-targeted-expensive/#more-36337). But
what can you as an individual do against it? To be honest there is no
magic silver bullet that solves all problems. But with a few steps you
can make it very hard for an attacker black mail you.


First of all and you do not wanna hear it again, but patch, patch, patch.
Keep all your systems updated all the time and install updates as soon as
possible. Why? Most updates do not only improve the functionality of your
software, they also fix vulnerabilities. And what is malware based on?
Exactly! Vulns in your software, which get exploited to gain more privileges, spread through the network, to replicate and finally to encrypt all
your data. The more up to date your software is, the less likely it is that
current malware will be able to work, because the vulnerabilites are 
patched. You may argue that there are still zero days. OK - compared to
known vulnerabilties it is hard to write software that relies on zero
days and thereby expensive. Now, a normal attacker is in the game for 
money. Investing upfront in a zero days and then spreading the ransom
ware is not his business model - that is something for state sponsored 
attacks which are a completely different topic.


What is next? Backups - keep offline backups - at least once a month. At
the current state of ransomware it works fast and encrypts all in one
big step. You may loose all your data when the ransom ware executes exactly
in that moment when you do your backup - but what a timing this must be.
It is very important that do connect your backup drive only for the copying
process and detach it right away after you are done. If it stays 
permanently mounted onto your computer it will be encrypted in an attack
as well.


As a third step consider setting up a web filter for all connections to the
internet. Recently I stumbled over [UpriBox](https://upribox.org/). This is
actually a privacy filter, but with a few tweaks it can be easily turned 
into a strict web filtering solution. I will talk more about this within
the following posts. However UpriBox is not the only way to do it. Several
sites exist that summarize currently know malware distributing web sites. 
Build your own system to poll them and include the list in your black list.
Most home routers today offer the possibility to block certain domains. Use
it even - if you need to update the list of blocked domains manually every
couple of weeks.


As a forth step and this is the most important point of all: 
Be sceptical. Do take 30 seconds or more to breath and think (!) 
before you click on 
a link or open an attachment. I know this is the hardest step and 
everybody fails at one point in time. However, most ransomware attacks 
are successful because some clicked on a malicious link or attachment. 
So keep your eyes open think twice and then decide what to do.
[Brian Krebs post](http://krebsonsecurity.com/2016/09/ransomware-getting-more-targeted-expensive/#more-36337) provides you with even more
steps how to secure your environment like for example reduce privileges to
an absolute minimum or application whitelisting. I do not contratdict his
advices. They are all valid and things you should do. However, keep in mind
that most of them help to prevent damage after you clicked on a malicious
link or attachment. The click is the real problem and this should be
tackled first.


Finally - hey, keep in mind: life and technology should be fun.
Do not get all scared and frightened. Not every one is evil. And the few, 
who are, now have more possibilities to reach you. But you have also 
more ways to protect you. Being sceptical and thinking critically is your
best weapon! 

Cheers!
